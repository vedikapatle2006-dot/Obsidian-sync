# Obsidian Sync

**Decentralized File Synchronization Metadata Registry on Ethereum**

## Project Description
Obsidian Sync is a smart contract system that brings Obsidian.md-style seamless note synchronization to the decentralized world. Instead of relying on centralized cloud providers, users store file content off-chain (IPFS, Arweave, etc.) while keeping immutable, versioned metadata and access control on-chain.

This creates a trustless, auditable, and permissioned sync layer for local-first applications.

## Project Vision
To make personal knowledge bases truly sovereign:  
- You own your data  
- You control who can sync with your vault  
- Every change is cryptographically verifiable  
- No single point of failure or censorship

Think "Obsidian + Git + Ethereum + IPFS" — but simple enough for everyday users.

## Key Features
- **On-chain file metadata** (name, content hash, CID, timestamp, version)
- **Per-vault access control** — grant/revoke sync rights to other wallets
- **Immutable sync history** via events
- **Off-chain storage compatible** (IPFS, Arweave, Filecoin, etc.)
- **Conflict-free versioning** (client handles merge, chain records truth)

## Future Scope
- Merkle-proof based lightweight sync for mobile/light clients
- Encrypted vaults with Lit Protocol or threshold encryption
- Cross-chain sync via LayerZero / Hyperlane
- Subscription-based premium vaults (pay per sync slot)
- Integration with Farcaster Frames and XMTP for social note sharing
- Plugin for actual Obsidian.md desktop app

**Own your thoughts. Sync without compromise.**
